    <p>
        The Time complexity of an algorithm is a measure of the amount of time it takes to complete as a function of the input size. It is an essential factor in determining the efficiency and performance of an algorithm. When analyzing time complexity, we evaluate how the algorithm's execution time increases or decreases with the size of the input.
        
        efficient algorithms strive for lower time complexity, aiming to minimize the time required to perform a specific task as the input size grows. Commonly expressed using big-O notation, time complexity provides an upper bound on the growth rate of an algorithm's running time concerning its input size.</p>

        <b>Space complexity</b> is a crucial aspect of algorithmic analysis that focuses on quantifying the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to the input size. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of memory usage. Analyzing space complexity helps in understanding how the memory requirements of an algorithm scale as the input size increases.

One common way to express space complexity is using big-O notation, denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) represents the upper bound on the growth rate of the space requirements concerning the input size (n). For example, O(n) indicates that the space complexity grows linearly with the size of the input.
